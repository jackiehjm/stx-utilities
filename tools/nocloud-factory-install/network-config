# Cloud-init networking config.
#
# "This network configuration format lets users customise their instanceâ€™s networking
# interfaces by assigning subnet configuration, virtual device creation (bonds, bridges, VLANs)
# routes and DNS configuration." [1]
#
# This config is meant to be a placeholder. It should be
# updated based on the factory node networking requirements.
